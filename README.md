# sql_sample
This is a collection of my sample SQL files.

This project includes three samples from my Master of Business Analytics program at the University of Montana, Applied Data Analytics course in Fall 2022. The dataset has a total of 38,838 rows and five tables. The five tables are: date_hour, department_date, departments, owner_spend_date, and owners. The variables in each table are as below:


| Table_name | variable_1 | variable_2 | variable_3 | variable_4 | variable_5 | 
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |    
| date_hour | date   | hour   | spend   | trans   | items   |
| department_date | date   | department   | spend   | trans   | items   |
| departments | department   | dept_name   |      |      |      |
| owner_spend_date | card_no   | date   | spend   | trans   | items   |
| owners | card_no | zip   | plus_2   | status   | date_joined   |

In addition to SQLite, this project interacts with Google Big Query (GBQ) and Python in samples 2 and 3 respectively.
