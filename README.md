# sql_sample
This is a collection of my sample SQL files.

This project includes three samples from my Applied Data Analytics course in Fall 2022, Master of Business Analytics program at the University of Montana. The dataset has a total of 38,838 rows and five tables. The five tables are: date_hour, department_date, departments, owner_spend_date, and owners. 


| Table Name | variable_1 | variable_2 | variable_3 | variable_4 | variable_5 | 
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |    
| Seconds | 301   | 283   | 301   | 283   | 283   |
The five variables in the table date_hour are date, hour, spend, trans, and items. 

The five variables in department_date are date, department, spend, trans, and items.

The two variables in departments are department and dept_name.

The five variables in owner_spend_date are card_no, date, spend, trans, and items.

The five variables in owners are card_no, zip, plus_2, status, and date_joined.
