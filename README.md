# sql_sample
A collection of my sample SQL files.

This project includes three samples from my Applied Data Analytics course in Fall 2022, Master of Business Analytics program at the University of Montana. The dataset has a total of 38,838 rows and five tables. The five tables are: date_hour, department_date, departments, owner_spend_date, and owners. 

The five variables in the table date_hour are date, hour, spend in USD, trans, and items.
